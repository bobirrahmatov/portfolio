## What Is Dataiku?

**Dataiku** is an end-to-end platform designed to democratize data science and machine learning. It empowers analysts, data scientists, and business stakeholders to collaborate on data preparation, analysis, and model deployment—all within one interface.

Think of it as the **Google Docs of data science workflows**—accessible, collaborative, and easy to version and manage.

## Why Use Dataiku?

Whether you're building dashboards or training predictive models, Dataiku offers:

- **Visual Pipelines:** Drag-and-drop workflows for data cleaning, joining, aggregations, and modeling.
- **Code Flexibility:** Mix Python, SQL, R, or even notebooks seamlessly with visual steps.
- **Built-in ML Capabilities:** Train models with AutoML or customize them with your own code.
- **Scalability:** Run your workflows on your machine, in the cloud, or on Spark clusters.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Shared datasets, version control, wikis, comments, and role-based access.

## Core Concepts in Dataiku

### 1. **Projects**

Everything in Dataiku happens within a project. A project contains datasets, recipes (data transformation steps), models, dashboards, wikis, and more.

### 2. **Datasets**

Dataiku supports many data sources—CSV files, SQL databases, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc. Datasets can be imported, created via code, or generated by transformation recipes.

### 3. **Recipes**

Recipes are the heart of your pipeline. Each recipe represents a transformation:

- **Visual Recipes**: Join, Filter, Group, Stack, etc.
- **Code Recipes**: Python, R, SQL, etc.
- **Modeling Recipes**: AutoML for classification, regression, clustering.

### 4. **Flow**

The Flow is a visual DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) showing how datasets and recipes connect. It’s the **main workspace** for all your data processes.

### 5. **AutoML and Model Evaluation**

Train models in just a few clicks. Evaluate them with built-in metrics, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

```python
# Sample Python recipe snippet in Dataiku
import dataiku
import pandas as pd

# Load input dataset
input_df = dataiku.Dataset("sales_data").get_dataframe()

# Do some processing
input_df["revenue"] = input_df["units_sold"] * input_df["price"]

# Write to output dataset
output_df = dataiku.Dataset("sales_revenue")
output_df.write_with_schema(input_df)
```

## Who Is It For?

Dataiku is great for:

- **Business Analysts** – No-code/low-code access to data pipelines
- **Data Engineers** – Build robust, reusable data flows
- **Data Scientists** – Code, train, evaluate, and deploy ML models
- **Executives** – View insights and dashboards without technical overhead

## How to Get Started

1. **Sign Up:** Go to [Dataiku.com](https://www.dataiku.com/) and request access or try the free edition.
2. **Install or Use Cloud Version:** Use the hosted trial, or download and run it locally (Docker and VM options available).
3. **Start a New Project:** Use a sample project or create one from scratch.
4. **Follow a Tutorial:** The [Dataiku Academy](https://academy.dataiku.com) is a great place to begin.

## Final Thoughts

Dataiku makes it easier than ever to work with data, build machine learning models, and turn them into production workflows—all with transparency and collaboration built in. In the next post, we’ll walk through setting up your first Dataiku project and importing datasets to begin building your flow.

Stay tuned!
