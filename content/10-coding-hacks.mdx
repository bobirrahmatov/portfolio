## A Developer’s Shortcut Toolkit

Even the most seasoned developers occasionally come across small snippets of code that leave them thinking: _“Wait, that actually works?”_ This post brings you **10 practical and surprising coding hacks** across JavaScript, Python, and more that can save time, reduce boilerplate, and even impress your team.

Let’s get right to it.

---

## 1. Destructure Objects Like a Pro

```js
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30, role: "Admin" };
const { name, ...rest } = user;
console.log(name); // Alice
console.log(rest); // { age: 30, role: "Admin" }
```

This pattern is useful for extracting specific values while keeping the remainder intact for further use or passing downstream.

---

## 2. Use Double Bitwise NOT (`~~`) for Fast Integer Conversion

```js
console.log(~~"42"); // 42
console.log(~~3.14); // 3
```

It’s faster than `parseInt()` and cleaner than `Math.floor()` when truncating positive numbers.

> ⚠️ Use carefully—this doesn’t work well with large numbers or negative floats.

---

## 3. Quickly Check for Empty Objects

```js
const isEmpty = (obj) => Object.keys(obj).length === 0;
```

This one-liner eliminates the need for `for...in` loops or external libraries when checking empty states.

---

## 4. Use Array `at()` for Clean Reverse Indexing

```js
const items = [10, 20, 30, 40];
console.log(items.at(-1)); // 40
```

No more messy `arr[arr.length - 1]` when grabbing from the end of an array.

---

## 5. Flip Booleans With a Bitwise XOR

```js
let flag = 1;
flag ^= 1;
console.log(flag); // 0
```

Elegant for toggling between binary states (`0 ↔ 1`) in game loops, UI components, or memory-sensitive applications.

---

## 6. Swap Two Variables Without a Temp

```js
let a = 5,
  b = 10;
[a, b] = [b, a];
```

Modern JavaScript makes swapping variables clean and readable.

---

## 7. Short-Circuit Defaulting

```js
function greet(user) {
  const name = user?.name || "Guest";
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
```

Safe, concise, and expressive—this is a standard pattern for dealing with optional values or nulls.

---

## 8. Reverse a String the Clever Way

```js
const reversed = (str) => [...str].reverse().join("");
console.log(reversed("hello")); // "olleh"
```

Spread syntax works on strings too—no need for verbose `for` loops.

---

## 9. Conditional Property Inclusion in Objects

```js
const isAdmin = true;
const user = {
  name: "Sam",
  ...(isAdmin && { role: "admin" }),
};
```

Create dynamic, conditionally extended objects—great for building JSON payloads or config maps.

---

## 10. Shorthand for Nullish Values

```js
const foo = null ?? "default";
console.log(foo); // "default"
```

Unlike `||`, `??` won’t override `0` or `false`—only `null` and `undefined`.

---

## Final Thoughts

These aren’t just “cool tricks”—they’re **micro-optimizations and clean code techniques** that help write expressive, modern, and maintainable code. Whether you're building apps, APIs, or experimenting with side projects, these hacks are worth memorizing and sharing with your team.
