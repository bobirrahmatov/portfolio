## Moving From ML Experiments to Business Results

AI and analytics teams often build technically sound models that never make it to production — or worse, never generate measurable business value.

This post outlines **7 technical and organizational strategies** for developers, data scientists, and platform engineers to help their organizations extract meaningful ROI from AI initiatives.

## 1. Assign a Value Owner

Even the best ML models are pointless without business validation. Assign a **value owner** per project — often a product manager or business lead — who is accountable for tracking actual impact (e.g., cost savings, revenue, efficiency) quarterly.

As a developer, involve them early to define meaningful success criteria.

---

## 2. Build a Use Case Pipeline (Not One-Off Projects)

Mature organizations maintain a **living pipeline** of AI use cases — mapped by complexity, potential impact, and reusability.

**Pro tip:** Capture reusable components (e.g., ingestion flows, feature pipelines, models) in a shared repository so future projects build on past work.

---

## 3. Run Technical Workshops for Executives

Don’t let AI stay siloed in IT or the data team.

Run periodic **executive-facing sessions** to explain infrastructure requirements, model lifecycle, and where decision makers fit into the process (e.g., approval, feedback loops, governance ownership).

**Case: GE Aviation** holds full-day executive workshops focused on how their self-service analytics program works across teams.

---

## 4. Bake in Change Management

Technical delivery is 50% of the job — the other half is organizational readiness.

Set expectations that **AI maturity is a multi-year journey**. Establish communication channels, sprint demos, and stakeholder check-ins early to manage change iteratively.

Pfizer spent nearly a decade going from theory to scaled transformation — driven by a collaborative, tech-enabled operating model.

---

## 5. Prioritize Platform Strategy Over Tool Sprawl

Juggling 5+ disconnected tools across the AI lifecycle (ETL, training, MLOps, monitoring, GenAI) slows velocity and adds maintenance overhead.

Use an **end-to-end AI platform** like Dataiku to consolidate key workflows. Benefits:

- Shared metadata and lineage
- Unified access control and governance
- Lower TCO over time

This also reduces friction in DevOps, onboarding, and retraining cycles.

---

## 6. Measure Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Don’t just track model performance — track cost.

Use platform telemetry and financial ops reviews to estimate:

- Infra + compute usage
- Licensing fees per tool
- Maintenance/dev overhead per team
- Hidden costs of tool switching or scaling

If you're managing platform strategy, present TCO quarterly to justify architecture decisions.

---

## 7. Enable Business Users With Guardrails

Scaling value = **co-building projects with domain experts** — not shielding them from data.

Tactical steps to do this safely:

- Provision sandboxed environments in Dataiku
- Create roles + permissions for governed autonomy
- Provide training paths for different technical levels
- Build templates and wizards to abstract repetitive tasks

Bonus: This reduces data team backlog by pushing simpler work downstream.

## Wrap-Up: Sustainable AI = Tech + Business Alignment

Generating business value from AI isn’t about model complexity — it’s about systems that **connect data, users, and goals at scale**.

Whether you’re a platform owner, ML engineer, or data scientist, these 7 strategies can help your org move beyond experimentation and build AI that matters.
